At Flyyer.io we are aware of the relevance of digital marketing in these hyper connectivity times. If someone denied it a few months ago, online sales of 2020 were in charge of ensuring it is.

And how could it not be, if even though we think that we are all connected, year after year new users continue to be added, due to the digitization of EVERYTHING. Well, almost everything. This means that **brands are having a much better chance of reaching their customers and attracting new ones.**

In this context, digital marketing is vital for business. If we think of any brand, it is most likely that it has its website, and if it does not, we can find it on a social network, this being the "default" way in which users expect to connect with their favorite brands.

There are many strategies to carry out good campaigns, but one of the formats that is most attractive to users is the one that incorporates **visual content**, which, as its name indicates, has as its protagonist images, colors and shapes rather than texts.

The reasons? **Let's see.**

So we are faced with information overload every day. 3. BRANDS MUSTADAPT. 4. Visual content is the key. Human brain can process images 60,000 times faster than text. 5. THE CAT IS SLEEPING ON THE WINDOW. 6. Studies estimate that 65% of the population learns visually. They understand and reatin information better with images and videos. 7. According to the Wyzowl's State of Video Marketing 2018 survey, 83% of consumers who saw branded videos, considered sharing them with their close friends.](/img/blogposts/infografia-mkt.jpg)

And brands know it. It is no wonder platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and Pinterest are so successful.

**‚ÄúA picture worth a thousand words‚Äù, Yes, we've all heard this. Because it's true.**

## What makes it so special?

Visual content creates more powerful campaigns that prompt the brain to remember or relate to something, like a product or a brand, rather than sentences that are quickly forgotten. and users love to share something they like.

Of course, not every visual advertising will work in the same way. And we discovered that there is an instance in social media interactions that most brands have missed. **Link previews...**

Our eyes work like a scanner. When we scroll down on social media, we see a striking image and we stop and look at every detail of it, whether for some purpose or not. **Those images that attract attention generate clicks.**

But for some reason, when sharing links, the previews seem sloppy, as if they were not part of the interaction. Some links do not even generate them. We strongly believe that brand owners should take care of the issue, take advantage of a marketing opportunity that can be massed by the same users. This can make web pages more accessible by showing the user a hint of the content. **And that builds trust**. (link to ux research blogpost)

### Is it really important?

We did some user experience research and about 74% of the users we surveyed declared that they frequently send and receive links, and 79% of them affirmed that to click on them, they look at the previewed content.
